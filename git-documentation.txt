Git is how we communicate as a team of developers

cd .git/
git config --local user.email "adi.chris@traveloka.com"

everything in git is an object

git log --oneline --decorate --all --graph

> git merge
    ++ conflict
> git status


git config --local rerere.enabled true

try new process for hotfix and relesae

1. request review. Once developers land their work to release, do they need to request review to develop? (it would be great if they don't have to do that)
2. Make sure every hotfix is land to both release and develop
3. Thus, no need to merge branch release to develop
